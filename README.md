# 3D-Lidar-Scanner

The LiDAR Room Scanning System is an innovative project designed to capture precise spatial data of indoor environments. This system employs LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology, a method used for measuring distances to a target by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflected light with a sensor. Our project focuses on mapping rooms and corridors efficiently, providing a detailed 3D point cloud model of the scanned area.

Key Features
Spatial Data Acquisition: Utilizes LiDAR technology for high-precision mapping of rooms and corridors.
Arduino-driven Time of Flight Sensor: Incorporates a Time of Flight (ToF) sensor managed by Arduino for accurate distance measurements and point cloud data collection.
Motor Control for Sensor Rotation: Features a motor control mechanism developed with Virolig to enable systematic rotation of the LiDAR sensor, ensuring comprehensive spatial data capture.
Data Transformation Algorithms: Implements algorithms to transform raw sensor readings into 3D point cloud models, enabling detailed spatial representation and visualization.
Technical Stack
Microcontroller: Arduino
Sensors: Time of Flight (ToF) sensor for LiDAR
Software: Open3D for 3D model visualization, Virolig for motor control
Languages: Embedded C/C++ for Arduino programming
Project Goals
Our primary objective was to engineer a cost-effective and precise room scanning system. By leveraging LiDAR technology and innovative data processing algorithms, we aimed to create a tool that could significantly aid in interior design, architecture, and construction planning. The project also serves as a foundation for future developments in autonomous navigation and space utilization analysis.
